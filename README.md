Down to earth autocomplete service built in Golang and backed by titan Elasticsearch.

I wrote it all in one go (no pun intended) after dinner. So it was about 5 hours of straight up coding through out the night up to this very point.

Any day soon I'll come back and for another sprint in this project. So I'll let a todo list below.

## TODO

* Case insensitivity;
* .env file;
* Make sure docker/docker-compose are on point;
* Test suite, I guess.

Whatever. I must sleep now.
